# Asphaltene depressurization

This folder contains the codes in Python (.py and .ipynb) used to post-process and analyze the results from CG MD simualtions of a PVT depressurization
process.

## The system

The system contains asphaltene molecules in the oil mixture toluene-methane (90:10 wt/wt % or 69:31 mol/mol %). The oil mixture is composed of 6268 toluene
molecuels, 400 methane molecules, and 43 asphaltene molecules, thus the asphaltane mass fraction is 5 %. All molecules are coarse-grained using the
SAFT-gamma potential (Avenda&#241;o et al., 2013; Papaioannou et al., 2014).

## Test data

The folder test_data contains two folders with two excerpts from the results at the pressures 700 and 400 atm.
